# Algebra II Vocabulary Sheet

## Why Does This Exist?
I made this vocabulary guide-centralized document because I was very interested in maths by the time I had hit 11th grade.
I was passionate about learning more, yet, I ran into some institutional and personal barriers that slowed down my progress in a topic I had increasingly began to love.
_The textbooks were too dense and I felt alone._ _**Nobody should ever have to feel this way, so I created my algebra-guide, and compiled all the coursework into 1 pdf in reverse order of assignment.**_

## Why Should I Use This?
1. It's free
2. It gives a big-picture, less dense view than a textbook _(can still be very word heavy, I'm sorry abt that ;-;)_
3. It was made by a student that _**really struggled with algebra 2 while they were struggling and shortly after.**_
4. It gives jumping off points for topics such as _programming and higher level mathematics._
